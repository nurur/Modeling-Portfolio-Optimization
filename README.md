Portfolio Optimization Problem Formulation:

Invest the entirety of capital K in an asset universe comprising N securities. No short-sell 
is allowed. Denote the proportion of the capital invested in asset i by W_i. The allocation 
policy is based on the variants of the mean-variance (Markowitz) portfolio optimization model. 
The problem is to minimize the variance of the portfolio's return given that an expected 
return will be at least or equal to a threshold value R.


a) Formulate portfolio optimization problem as a quadratic optimization. 

b) Provide an equivalent second-order cone programming formulation of part a).

c) Provide an AMPL code for the formulation of parts a) and b). Add a constraint that 
stipulates that one can invest in at most 12 securities and set the minimal level of 
expected return to 5%.
